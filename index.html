                <p>Earlier this year (January 2018).
                    started to think about how I could
                    improve my design skills and attract
                    more customers. I wanted to start
                    designing some ideas that for a
                    long time I had only on paper and
                    stored on my cell phone, I decided
                    to look for some challenge, something
                    that makes more sense with what I thought
                    . I saw that many designers (especially in
                    dribbble) made a daily user interface,
                    I really liked the idea, but the problem
                    was that the result was just something
                    nice and did not solve any problem.
